```

**VS Code Integration:**
1. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type: **"Tasks: Run Task"**
3. Select **⚡ Show Generator Diagnostics**

For keyboard shortcuts and status bar integration, see [.vscode/SETUP.md](../.vscode/SETUP.md).

**Output:**
- **WHIZ001** (Info) - Discovered receptors (green)
- **WHIZ002** (Warning) - No receptors found (yellow)
- **WHIZ003** (Error) - Invalid implementations (red)

**Example:**
```
🔍 Running Whizbang source generator diagnostics...

info WHIZ001: Found receptor 'OrderReceptor' handling CreateOrder → OrderCreated
info WHIZ001: Found receptor 'PaymentReceptor' handling ProcessPayment → PaymentProcessed
```

## Maintenance

### remove-coverage-from-history.sh

Removes coverage files from Git history (reduces repository size).

**⚠️ WARNING: Rewrites Git history - use with caution!**

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/maintenance/remove-coverage-from-history.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Removes all `*.coverage`, `*.coveragexml`, and `coverage.xml` files from history
- Reduces repository size
- **Requires force push** after running

**Only run if:**
- Coverage files were accidentally committed
- Repository size needs reduction
- You have team agreement to rewrite history

## Prerequisites

### PowerShell Core (pwsh)

All scripts require PowerShell Core for cross-platform compatibility.

**Install PowerShell Core:**

- **Windows**: Included with Windows 10+, or install PowerShell 7+ from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)
- **macOS**: `brew install powershell`
- **Linux**: See [installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux)

**Verify installation:**
```powershell
pwsh --version
```

## Script Standards

All scripts in this directory follow these standards:

- ✅ **PowerShell Core** for cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ **kebab-case.ps1** naming convention
- ✅ **Categorized folders** (coverage, benchmarks, diagnostics, maintenance)
- ✅ **Parameter validation** with help documentation
- ✅ **Error handling** with `Set-StrictMode` and `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`
- ✅ **Colored output** for better readability

For detailed script development standards, see [ai-docs/script-standards.md](../ai-docs/script-standards.md).

## Contributing

When adding new scripts:

1. **Choose category**: coverage, benchmarks, diagnostics, maintenance, or create new category
2. **Use PowerShell Core**: `.ps1` files preferred over `.sh`
3. **Follow naming**: kebab-case (e.g., `run-all-tests.ps1`)
4. **Add parameters**: Use param block with validation
5. **Include help**: Add comment-based help at top of script
6. **Update README**: Document the new script here
7. **Test cross-platform**: Verify on Windows, macOS, and Linux

See [ai-docs/script-standards.md](../ai-docs/script-standards.md) for detailed guidelines.
