-- Migration: 024_ClaimOrphanedOutbox.sql
-- Date: 2026-04-21 (owner-preferring claim — fixes rank-churn wedge, production incident)
-- Description: Creates claim_orphaned_outbox function for claiming orphaned outbox messages.
--              Owner-preferring semantics: a stream's live owner always claims its
--              messages; partition-based load balancing applies only to unowned /
--              abandoned-owner streams.
-- Dependencies: 001-023 (requires wh_outbox, wh_active_streams tables, compute_partition function)

COMMENT ON FUNCTION __SCHEMA__.claim_orphaned_outbox IS
'Claims orphaned outbox messages with expired or null leases. Owner-preferring: a stream''s live owner always claims its messages (FIFO per-stream, immune to rank churn from scale events). Partition-modulo load balancing applies only to streams with no live owner. An abandoned (non-heartbeating) instance''s lease does NOT block cross-instance claims, giving SIGKILL-tolerant recovery bounded by the stale threshold rather than the 300 s active-streams lease. Returns claimed message IDs for Orphaned flag in orchestrator response.';
