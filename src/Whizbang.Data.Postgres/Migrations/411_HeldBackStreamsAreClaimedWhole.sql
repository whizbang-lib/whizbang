-- Date: 2026-11-13
-- Description: A held-back stream is claimed whole, and a row held back is not charged an attempt (#2120).
--
--              A received event is held back from storing while an earlier pending event of its stream is not held by
--              this instance (230). The claim reads each priority band through a window of its oldest rows (159), so
--              on a busy service an interactive event whose earlier events are background priority was claimed on
--              every lease while its predecessors, outside the background window, were never claimed. Each claim
--              charged it an attempt, and it was dead-lettered once it exhausted them (#2117). Owner decision
--              (2026-11-07): both of the following.
--
--                1. claim_orphaned_inbox (copied from its last word, 317): for each stream the batch picked, the events
--                   received before its first picked row that no live lease holds are taken with it, whatever their
--                   priority, ahead of its picked rows and in the stream's lane, at most as many as the stream's
--                   picked rows. The batch bound is unchanged, so the predecessors displace the stream's later rows
--                   in that batch, which would only have waited for them.
--                2. _emit_event_store_chain_for_inbox (copied from its last word, 391): a row the calling claim leased
--                   (its lease_expiry is the claim's) that the store pass held back is refunded the attempt the claim
--                   counted. A held-back row is never offered (349), so the attempt bought nothing; waiting is not
--                   failing. A row held back since an earlier claim was refunded by that claim's pass.
--
--              A row held back behind an event another live instance holds is still acquired and waits (it is refunded
--              each time), as the claim cannot take a row a live lease holds.
--
--              Number 411: 403 is the highest on develop, and 404 to 410 are taken by changes in flight.
--
-- Reversal: reversible (both functions are restored from their last words, 317 and 391; the function keeps no state, and
--           attempts already refunded stay refunded, which only means those rows were not charged for waiting)
-- Dependencies: 317 (claim_orphaned_inbox's last word), 391 (_emit_event_store_chain_for_inbox's last word), 230 (the
--               hold-back), 349 (the re-offer skips an unstored event)
-- Objects: claim_orphaned_inbox, _emit_event_store_chain_for_inbox
-- Constants: the double-underscore tokens in this file (for example __CATEGORY_PERSPECTIVE__) are substituted from
--            Migrations/constants.txt at apply time (README rule 12).

  --
  --   WHERE processed_at IS NULL AND (instance_id IS NULL OR lease_expiry < p_now)
  --
  -- A disjunction has no index order, so each of the five walked the whole pending inbox and threw
  -- away what a live peer holds -- one plan removed 4,716 rows of 4,800 by filter to yield seven
  -- streams -- and fetched a heap page per row doing it, because the stream-ordered index carries
  -- neither is_event nor priority and a queue table under load is never all-visible, so nothing on
  -- it is ever really index-only. Five passes over the backlog per poll, several polls a second,
  -- every instance. Doubling the backlog doubled the poll.
  --
  -- Split in two, each half is a partial predicate a planner can prove, so 159's indexes carry the
  -- order: unowned rows by arrival, leased rows by lease expiry so the longest-expired come first.
  -- One walk per band per class, each stopped at the window, each covered by its index. The bucket
  -- is the leading key so a band draws from its own range: a large background backlog can never
  -- crowd an interactive row out of the window, and the background floor below still finds the
  -- background band populated. Rows of one stream keep their arrival order, which is what per-stream
  -- FIFO rests on, and the lanes' own band, kind, ownership and partition filters are unchanged --
  -- this narrows what they read, never what they choose.
  --
  -- The window is a bound the LIMITs below could not provide on their own. A lane stops at its
  -- LIMIT only when it can reach it, and during an import most pending rows belong to a peer or to
  -- another rank, so a lane that wants eleven streams and can see seven never stops early and runs
  -- to the end of the table. The bound has to be on rows examined, not on rows found.
  --
  -- The scheduled_for predicate rides along: a row that is not due yet is not claimable now, and
  -- every lane applied it.
  -- Each lane names its band as a LITERAL, and the reason is the only reason: a partial index is
  -- considered only when Postgres can prove the query's predicate implies the index's, and that
  -- proof is textual. The previous shape selected a band by comparing a CASE expression to a bucket
  -- column joined in from a VALUES list, which is not provable against ANY band predicate because
  -- the bucket is a join column and not a constant. Every band index was therefore unusable, and
  -- the lanes fell back to reading the whole pending set once per bucket -- O(backlog) on the
  -- hottest path in the system, while the three indexes they were meant to read went on charging
  -- every claim write for nothing. Measured on 300k pending rows with the held-lane index in
  -- place, which is the comparison that is actually fair: 11,102 buffers and 5,249ms against
  -- 5 buffers and under 20ms. The old shape DID reach an index -- the held-lane one -- but it
  -- leads with instance_id, so for the unowned set it reads the whole backlog per bucket and
  -- top-N sorts, because received_at sits late in its key. The band indexes are keyed on
  -- (received_at, message_id), which is the ORDER BY, so they stop at the LIMIT.
  --
  -- A plpgsql constant would reintroduce the same defect. c_interactive_band_end is a PARAMETER at
  -- plan time, and the generic plan plpgsql settles into after a few executions cannot fold it, so
  -- the bounds are written here as the same literals the index predicates carry. That agreement is
  -- held by PriorityLaneIndexUsabilityTests against WorkPriority, not by hope.
  --
  -- The four lanes partition the pending set with no overlap: interactive takes the whole band
  -- regardless of kind (its index has no is_event predicate), the two event lanes take their bands,
  -- and commands take everything else that is not an event. Each keeps its own claim_window, so a
  -- deep background band cannot consume the budget an interactive row needs.

  -- this pass first would number them ahead of the head another claim leased earlier and has not stored yet.

  -- store, and not leased to this instance under a live lease (a peer's lease, an expired one, none, or a lease a
  -- concurrent claim has not committed). Every row of this batch that sorts after the stream's first such event
  -- waits: it is not stored and not stamped, so the next claim re-reads it, and fetch_inbox_batch does not hand
  -- it to the dispatcher before it is stored. Rows before it are stored now, so the head of a stream never waits.
  -- The order is the message id, the order this pass has always numbered by (slice 1): a fan-out child's id is

  -- it, and the lease test is answered from the index, so only a row this pass does not hold reads the heap. No
  -- index is added: wh_inbox_state's index count is a gated design property (InboxStateWriteCostScenarioTests).

  '411 (#2120): a row the calling claim leased (lease_expiry = p_lease_expiry) that this pass held back is refunded the attempt the claim counted. Copies leased inbox events into the event store, stamps their origin and creates their perspective work (162). 214: the digest fold leaves out at-most-once events (flags & 32). 216: and audit records (#1492). 228: an event that would make its stream hold both ephemeral and Sourced events is dead-lettered instead (WHIZ133, #1546). 230: a row waits behind an earlier pending row of its stream that this pass does not hold, so a received stream is stored in the producer''s order (#1607). 260: keeps each stored stream''s wh_stream_lifecycle row, one upsert per batch (#1732). 266: dead-letters each received event a sealed stream refuses and stores the rest; a terminal event seals its stream in the same statement (#1733). 271: and each received event an archived stream refuses, by its type''s AppendToArchived policy, queuing the stream''s restore under AutoRestore (#1738). 285: each row keeps the slim form unless kept full, carries its route id, and under the Linked form stages its full form (#1725). 295: stamps a superseding event''s key (wh_event_store.supersede_key) and queues the older events of its key for the reaper (#1729). 296: starts the new generation of an archived stream whose type declares NewGeneration, numbered on from its last version (#1734). 352: and its superseding group (wh_event_store.supersede_group, #2124), so the older events of its group, not only its type, are queued. 367: a pass whose lock pass finds no candidate only stamps, and the collective routing runs only when a stored event is collective. 391: a collective event of a type no handler on this service applies gets no __collective__ row once every service registered in the schema has written its collective_gate marker (_wh_collective_row_wanted, #2145).';
