-- Description: A redelivery that stream integrity asked for stores an event inbox deduplication remembers but the
--              event store lost, so a repairable gap converges (#1843).
--
--              The deduplication row is written when a message is received, and the event-store row can be lost
--              afterwards: a failed or rolled-back fan-out in an older version, manual cleanup, a store restored from
--              an older backup while deduplication survived. Verification then counts the bucket short and repair asks
--              the origin to redeliver, but store_inbox_messages dropped every redelivered copy as a duplicate. The
--              redelivery's reconciliation (249) saw the event missing rather than present, so it did not mark the
--              bucket as one repair cannot change, and the bucket was asked for again on the terminal cadence forever.
--
--              store_inbox_messages takes a per-message RestoreIfMissing flag, set on the children of a redelivery
--              bundle and on nothing else. For such a child deduplication is checked against the event store: when the
--              id was seen, the child is an event integrity counts (not ephemeral, not at-most-once), and neither the
--              event store nor the inbox holds it, it is stored again, its envelope marked state only so the reactions
--              that already had their chance do not run a second time. Ordinary traffic keeps trusting deduplication,
--              and a duplicate of an event the store holds is still dropped.
--
--              One case is not safe to restore. wh_truncate_stream_prefix keeps a truncated stream's deduplication rows
--              precisely so that a redelivered copy is not stored below the truncation point, and a lost event cannot
--              be told from a truncated one. A child whose stream's lowest stored version is above 1 (its earlier
--              history was truncated here) is refused: stored settled with the reason in wh_inbox_state.error, never
--              claimed or copied. wh_reconcile_redelivered_bundle answers what wh_adopt_redelivered_origin answers plus
--              the refused children per bucket, so the reconciliation reports that bucket once as one repair cannot
--              change, through the 249 unhealable mark, instead of letting it be asked for forever.
--
--              Cost: the new tests run only for a repair child whose id deduplication had already seen, by primary key
--              and by the (stream_id, version) unique index; live delivery evaluates one boolean.
--
-- Dependencies: 242 (store_inbox_messages, the last word before this file), 249 (wh_adopt_redelivered_origin, the
--               unhealable mark), 006 (normalize_event_type), 240 (wh_truncate_stream_prefix)
-- Objects: store_inbox_messages, wh_reconcile_redelivered_bundle
-- Constants: the double-underscore tokens in this file (for example __SCHEMA__) are substituted at apply time (README rule 12).

-- store_inbox_messages: last word 242, with repair traffic checked against the event store (#1843). Signature unchanged.
