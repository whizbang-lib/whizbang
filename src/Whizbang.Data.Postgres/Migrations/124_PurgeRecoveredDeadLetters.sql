-- Migration: 124_PurgeRecoveredDeadLetters.sql
-- Date: 2026-09-01
-- Description: Re-creates perform_maintenance VERBATIM from 107 plus a new Task 11 that purges
--              settled wh_dead_letters rows older than dead_letter_retention_days (default 7).
--              wh_dead_letters previously had NO purge path anywhere in the framework, so every row
--              a consumer ever dead-lettered was kept forever. That is unbounded by construction:
--              the recovery path writes a NEW row per republish attempt rather than updating the
--              existing one, so a deployment that cannot drain its dead letters grows this table
--              without limit, and it sits in the same buffer pool that serves the inbox hot path.
--              Only SETTLED rows are reclaimable: Recovered(3) is finished business. Rows a human
--              still has to rule on (Pending(0), Recovering(1), HoldForReview(2)) and the forensic
--              record of what never succeeded (PermanentlyFailed(4)) are kept regardless of age,
--              because age is not evidence that anyone looked at them.
--              Gated on debug_mode like the other message-retention tasks: dead letters ARE
--              forensic message data, so a debugging operator keeps them.
-- Dependencies: 107 (perform_maintenance), 050 (wh_dead_letters)

  -- gating work item (no premature-reap window); an ephemeral event with no consuming perspective has
  -- no work item and is reapable at once. The wh_event_store pointer is left in place — a
  -- pointer-present / body-NULL row is the deterministic rebuild-guard signal (#13d), not a lost event.
  -- Skipped under debug_mode so retained forensic bodies survive with the retained work items.
  -- Grace window: a consumed body is also kept until it is OLDER than v_ephemeral_grace_seconds, so an
  -- out-of-order straggler can still rewind through it (rewind uses the surviving bodies + a snapshot floor).
  -- TTL floor (E2-4c): an AfterTtl event carries its own absolute expiry in body metadata
  -- ('ephemeral_expires_at', stamped at dispatch). It EXTENDS retention — the consumed body is kept until it
  -- is ALSO past that expiry. An event with no key (Sourced / WhenConsumed) is unaffected: the gate is
